# Detection-of-abandoned-objects
The project aims to develop a system that automatically detects abandoned objects (e.g. bags or suitcases) in public areas using surveillance footage. It enhances safety by alerting authorities to unattended items. Neural networks are not allowed only classical image analysis, feature extraction, and non-neural machine learning methods may be used.
